	<h1>Hi there, I'm Reid Bolding</h1>
	<p>Iâ€™m a student at Case Western Reserve University studying Engineering Physics. 
		I also work in CWRU's <a href="http://thinkbox.case.edu/">think[box]</a> 
		and <a href="https://interactive-commons.webflow.io/">Interactive Commons</a>
	</p>
	<p>
			My goal is to harness new technologies, especially innovative interfaces between people and computers, and use 
			them to unlock the barrier between human and machine and improve communication between us all.

			I currently do this by working on projects with the Microsoft Hololens and IoT devices embedded in the environment.
