    <h1>RFID machine shop access control system</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This is a project I started at a hackathon with my friends in spring 2018. It's a system intended to be used in a 
        machine shop where there is a large user base of varying skill levels. This prototype system consists of a web server 
        which can write permissions and identity to RFID cards from an online database and a wifi connected "access node" which can 
        be attached to a machine to track when it is turned on and to read the RFID cards. This system should prevent use of machines 
        which users may lack enough knowledge of, but more importantly it collects detailed usage data which can give real time overviews
        and provide a log of all time usage.

        Now, I am working on using that data to provide a more personalized experience to each individual user. Hopefully this will help 
        solve problems like the barrier to entry which new users encounter in a complex shop as well as the inconvenience which 
        experienced users encounter in a shop filled with tutorial information and simplified systems.
